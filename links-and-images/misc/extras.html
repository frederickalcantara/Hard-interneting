    <h2>Character Sets</h2>

    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

      <li>iki</li>
      <li>üç</li>
      <li>dört</li>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    
    <p>THere are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. 
      You should always use HTML entities for these three characters</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; 
      You&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
    <p>Unlike straight quotes, these curly quote entities should hug the text.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, we can insert any character directly into the HTML doc. 
      Entities are mainly useful for reserved characters or convenience when writing straight HTML.
