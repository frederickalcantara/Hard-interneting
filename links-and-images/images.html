	<h1>Images</h1>

	<p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for a <a

	<h2>JPGs</h2>

	<p>JPG images are good for photos. They can handle large color palettes without significantly increasing file size.
		These are also good for images/photos with lots of gradients. They don't allow transparent pizels, you will see all white pixels.
	</p>

	<h2>GIFs</h2>

	<p>GIFs are good for animations. They do provide simple color palettes, they use transparent pixels for binary options. 
		You can't use them for opaque levels. 
	</p>

	<h2>PNGs</h2>

	<p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons. They can handle opacity easily and there is no color palette limitation.
		A PNG is bigger than a JPG file, but they are similar quality to the human eye like the JPG. 
	</p>

	<h2>SVGs</h2>

	<p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. They are vector-based graphics that are lossless regardless of any scaling up or down.
		They are extremely useful for responsive design, but they can have a large influence on file size.
